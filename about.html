                    Hey there, I'm Nkengaka Noel, a Cameroonian born web developer currently embracing life in the
                    charming city of Vilnius, Lithuania. 
                    My journey into the exciting world of web development began in
                    2023, and I've been on an exhilarating ride ever since.

                    My first steps in this exciting field were taken with <strong>WordPress</strong>, where I expressed the art of
                    crafting visually stunning and dynamic websites. Eager to expand my horizons and dive deeper into
                    the world of coding, I found myself enrolling at <strong>Dublin CODING School</strong>, a decision that has ignited
                    my passion for learning new technologies in the field.

                    At Dublin CODING School, I'm on a continuous quest to master the building blocks of the web. <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> have become my creative outlets, allowing me to transform design concepts into captivating visuals that users love to explore. The allure of <strong>JavaScript</strong> has me hooked, as I dive headfirst into the world of interactivity, animations, and enhanced user experiences.

                    But that's not all, I'm also sinking my teeth into the intricacies of <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, venturing into the backend realm to bring dynamic functionalities to life. The thrill of connecting the dots and making things work seamlessly behind the scenes keeps me motivated and hungry for more.

                    Web development isn't just a job for me; it's a true passion that fuels my every step. I believe in crafting websites that transcend mere functionality, delivering immersive journeys that captivate users and leave a lasting impact. With each line of code I write, I'm driven by the desire to create digital landscapes that inspire, engage, and resonate.

                    When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you'll find me exploring the cultural tapestry of Vilnius, embracing new experiences, and soaking in the beauty of the city that I now call home. So, if you're ready to embark on a digital adventure together or simply want to connect, I'm just a message away. Let's create something extraordinary!
